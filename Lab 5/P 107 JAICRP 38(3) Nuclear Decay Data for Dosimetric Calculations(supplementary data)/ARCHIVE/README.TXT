                              ARCHIVE Folders

Each archive folder contains a README.TXT file that should be consulted for
further information.

INPUT Folder:  This folder contains the revised Evaluated Nuclear Structure 
               files (*.ens) used in EDISTR04 calculations.
              
OUTPUT Folder: This folder contains EDISTR04's output (*.OUT) files for the
               nuclides in the ICRP-07 collection. The file Mod_List.PDF details
               some modifications to the data in these files; e.g., to the
               branching fractions. These modifications have not been made in
               the individual *.OUT files but in final ICRP-07 files.
               
SOURCE Folder; This folder contains DECDATA's source code.  See README.TXT
               for further details.
